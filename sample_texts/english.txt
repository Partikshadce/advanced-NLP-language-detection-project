Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a subfield of linguistics, computer science, and artificial intelligence concerned with the interactions between computers and human language. It involves programming computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data. The goal is to enable computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language in a valuable way.

NLP combines computational linguistics with statistical, machine learning, and deep learning models. These technologies enable computers to process human language in the form of text or voice data and understand its full meaning, complete with the speaker's or writer's intent and sentiment.

Applications of NLP include machine translation, sentiment analysis, chatbots, speech recognition, text summarization, and question answering systems. As technology advances, NLP continues to evolve and improve, making human-computer interaction more natural and intuitive.
